# Context

## Current: Context View Embedding

Adapting the context-view tool from reference code and embedding it into the exploratory-repo type. The tool generates context descriptions by reading CLAUDE.md, scanning projects/ for timeline and state, and producing a self-updating CONTEXT.md at repo root. This project also moves working memory into .claude/rules/ for git-tracked portability.

See projects/03-context-view/

## Completed

Pillar Structure — Defined three pillars (Mycelium, Splectrum, HAICC) with directory structure and populated with existing content. See projects/02-pillar-structure/EVALUATION.md
