# Context

## Current: Context Metadata

Metadata structure (`.spl/`) with protocol mounting, addressing model, and `spl` runner. End-to-end invocation validates the design: `./spl context-view` resolves config, executes the tool, produces CONTEXT.md. Metadata conventions support descriptive data, protocol bindings, and future extensions without additional rules.

See projects/04-context-metadata/

## Completed

Context View Embedding — Scan/haiccer/persist pipeline for context description generation. Embedded tool into exploratory-repo with deterministic steps and entity interpretation.
  See projects/03-context-view/EVALUATION.md

Pillar Structure — Three-pillar directories (Mycelium, Splectrum, HAICC, exploratory-repo) with vocabulary and definitions. Structure made concerns visibly distinct.
  See projects/02-pillar-structure/EVALUATION.md

Initialization — Extracted seed documents to root, created repo structure, installed working memory into in-repo location, removed scaffolding.
  See projects/01-initialization/EVALUATION.md
