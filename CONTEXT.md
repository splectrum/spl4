# Context

## Current: File-Level Metadata

Extending `.spl` metadata structure to file-level contexts. Defined document specs for repo-root files (CLAUDE.md, CONTEXT.md) and project instance type definitions with file-level specs for REQUIREMENTS.md and EVALUATION.md. Established uniform meta/proto schema across files, directories, and type definitions. Ready for Mycelium API work with real metadata structure in place.

## Completed

Context View Embedding — adapted context-view tool for exploratory repos, moved working memory to .claude/rules/, established pipeline (scan → haiccer → persist)

Context Metadata — defined `.spl/` metadata structure, mounted context-view protocol, implemented `spl` runner, validated addressing model
  See projects/04-context-metadata/EVALUATION.md

Pillar Structure — organized repo into mycelium (data), splectrum (language), haicc (creative), and exploratory-repo (type) with vocabularies and definitions
  See projects/02-pillar-structure/EVALUATION.md

Initialization — extracted seed documents to root, created github repo, installed working memory, established project structure
