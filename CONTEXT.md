# Context

## Current: Documentation Consolidation

Three new model documents (protocols, bootstrap, scope) organizing architecture decisions from the protocol bundle projects. Four existing documents updated with new terminology. Establishes Mycelium as the authoritative source for protocol stack architecture and realization logic.

See projects/09-documentation/
