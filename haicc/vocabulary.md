# Vocabulary

## Entity

Any participant — human, AI, process, sensor, tool.
No special cases. The same principles apply to all.

## Build Cycle

The rhythm of creation: decide what to build, build it,
evaluate the result, evolve understanding. Each cycle
moves some steps forward, not the whole distance.

## Project

A context with a specific shape and lifecycle. Has
requirements, produces artifacts, gets evaluated.
Projects are numbered sequentially and become immutable
once sealed.

## Autonomy

The degree to which the system acts without entity
involvement. Maximum beneficial autonomy — if the system
can do it, it should. Entities step in where they add
genuine value.

## Iteration

A major cycle of work (spl3, spl4). Each iteration
has a mission, produces projects, and seeds the next
iteration when complete.
