# CLAUDE.md — Splectrum (spl4)

## What This Is

Splectrum is a living meaning system where entities
collaborate to create. Three pillars: Mycelium (data),
Splectrum (expression), HAICC (creation). See PRINCIPLES.md.

## Mission

spl4 is the integration iteration. Its mission is to connect
the Mycelium model to practical tool use, advancing both
through dogfooding. On completion, tools consume the context
layer, contexts describe themselves through stored metadata,
and the three concerns (defining meaning, created meaning,
capabilities) are structurally distinguishable.

## How We Work

- **Entity:** Any participant. Human, AI, process, sensor,
  capability. No forced divisions.
- **Maximum beneficial autonomy:** If the system can do it,
  it should. Entities participate where they add genuine value.
- **Technology decisions are AI's domain.** Don't defer, decide.
- **Don't plan endlessly.** Build. If it's wrong, fix it.
- **Meaning first.** Everything starts from meaning and intent,
  not from infrastructure or frameworks.
- **KISS.** Simplicity in realization. If a principle creates
  complexity, tweak the principle. The simplest mechanism that
  serves the purpose wins.

## The Build Cycle

AI decides what to build next, builds it, then we evaluate
together and evolve accordingly. Each build lives in
`projects/` as its own project. Shortest route to useful
tools — self-sufficiency first, not infrastructure for its
own sake.

Each iteration moves some steps forward, not the whole
distance.
