# Splectrum spl4 — Working Memory

## Repo
- GitHub: splectrum/spl4 (org, not personal)
- Prior iteration: splectrum/spl3 (9 projects, analysis)

## Mission
- spl4 is the integration iteration
- Connect Mycelium model to practical tool use
- Tools consume the context layer
- Stored metadata for self-describing contexts
- Build tools that help with the work

## The Model (proven)
- Record = key → content (opaque bytes)
- Context = container of records (recursive)
- Seven operations: list, read, flatten, create, write, delete, move
- Three layers: logical, capability, physical
- Flat API, metadata-driven behavior, nearest distance
- Changelog as sibling record, three modes
- Mutability is state (metadata), not type
- Atomic tools: proprietary internals, compatible boundaries

## Build Cycle
- AI decides what to build, builds it, evaluates with human
- Projects in `projects/` numbered sequentially
- Write REQUIREMENTS.md before code
- EVALUATION.md captures learnings
- Lightweight principles check at project boundaries
- Automate pre-commit actions (context-view sync etc.)

## Key Constraints
- KISS — simplicity in realization, tweak principles if needed
- Small but meaningful iterations
- Each iteration moves some steps, not the whole distance
- Don't build speculatively — earn features through need

## Process Notes
- Don't modify sealed (previous) projects
- Each project documents external changes it causes
- Immutability is retrospective: moving forward seals what came before
- Corrections/improvements belong to the current project
- Memory lives in .claude/rules/ (in-repo, git-tracked, portable)

## Pillar Structure
- mycelium/ — the data world (model, API, references, layers, tools)
- splectrum/ — the language world (concepts, requirements, quality gates)
- haicc/ — the creative world (build cycle, spawn, evaluator)
- exploratory-repo/ — context type for this kind of repo

## Reference Code
- `reference/context-view/` — CONTEXT.md generator (from spl3/05)
- `reference/context-layer/` — flat API, traversal, storage capabilities (from spl3/08)
- `reference/evaluator/` — requirements evaluation pipeline (from spl3/09)
