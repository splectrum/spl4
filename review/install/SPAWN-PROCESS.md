# Spawn Process

Steps discovered during spl4 → spl5 transition.
Prototype for the spawn protocol.

## Sequence

1. Critical review of current iteration
2. Write FOUNDATION.md — refined understanding,
   base layer for seed
3. Walk through foundation interactively
4. Build seed using foundation as lens:
   a. Pillar documentation — refine knowledge base
   b. Top-level documentation — frame with refined pillars
   c. Project extraction — compact into what next
      iteration builds on
   d. Initial memory — lean, built from everything above
   e. Review as reference — fold into ORIGINS
5. Create install package from seed
6. Insert into new iteration

## Observations

- Review is interactive: discussion and extraction,
  not just writing
- Foundation document drives all subsequent work
- Bottom-up: substance first, then framing, then
  distillation, then orientation, then history
- The spawn process itself starts as POC
- Current memory influences focus — bloated memory
  nudges wrong direction, so memory must be rebuilt
  not carried forward
- Positioning requires landscape research — the world
  moves, check if your differentiation still holds
- Background docs are the foundational statement;
  pillar docs are the active, evolving expression
- Process docs serve two consumers (builder + evaluator),
  keep both formats
- Documentation types: background (origins, principles,
  positioning), logical (pillar docs), operational
  (process, patterns, protocols)
