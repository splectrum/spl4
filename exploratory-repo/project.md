# Project

A context with a specific shape and lifecycle.

## Structure

- requirements record — expressed intent for the project
- evaluation record — fitness judgement and learnings
- artifact records — whatever the project produces

## Lifecycle

A project is mutable while active. When sealed, it
becomes immutable. Sealing is retrospective — moving
forward seals what came before.

## Container

Projects live within a projects context at the root.
They are ordered sequentially.
