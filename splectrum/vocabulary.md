# Vocabulary

## Definition

A statement of what something means. Definitions live
at the logical level — they express meaning independent
of any implementation. A definition can be evaluated
for faithful use.

## Requirement

A statement of what an implementation must satisfy.
Requirements live at the capability level — they derive
from definitions and bind meaning to realization.

## Concept

A named, defined idea that carries meaning. Concepts
are the building blocks of the language world — they
give structure to understanding.

## Protocol

A defined process — a sequence of steps or rules for
how something is done. Formalizes understanding into
repeatable action.

## Evaluation

Determining fitness against expressed intent. At the
logical level: whether definitions are faithfully used.
At the capability level: whether implementations satisfy
requirements.

## Quality Gate

A checkable assertion derived from a definition or
requirement. The point where expressed meaning becomes
verifiable.
