# Quality Gates

Checkable assertions derived from requirements. A
quality gate translates expressed intent into something
that can be verified — the point where meaning becomes
testable.

Quality gates are not separate from requirements.
They are requirements made precise enough to evaluate.
The translation from requirement to gate is itself a
Splectrum operation — understanding meaning well enough
to assert fitness.

Quality gates are entity-neutral. Any entity that
understands the language can check them.
