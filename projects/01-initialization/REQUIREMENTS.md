# Project 01: Initialization

## What

Execute Phase 4 of the spawn protocol: initialize spl4
from the seed prepared by spl3.

## Requirements

1. Read the seed directory and understand all contents
2. Create git repository and GitHub remote (splectrum/spl4)
3. Place seed documents at proper root locations
4. Decide what to do with reference code
5. Create the projects/ directory structure
6. Install working memory
7. Remove seed scaffolding
8. Document all decisions
9. Commit and push

## Decisions to Make

- Where does each document go?
- What happens to reference code?
- What happens to the seed directory after extraction?
- What goes in the initial .gitignore?
