# Project 02: Pillar Structure

## What

Make the three pillars visible in the repo structure.
Define what information belongs in each pillar, create
the directory layout, and populate with what we have.

## Why

The pillars exist as descriptions in PRINCIPLES.md but
have no structural presence. Meaning expressed through
collaboration (Splectrum) has no home separate from
implementation artifacts. There is no place for
logical-level requirements — only capability-level
requirements that live near their tools.

## Requirements

1. Define each pillar's scope — what information belongs
   in each bucket, with enough clarity to place things
   confidently

2. Create a directory structure that reflects the three
   pillars as first-class concerns

3. Populate each pillar with what we have so far:
   - Mycelium: the proven model, operations, layers
   - Splectrum: logical-level requirements for existing
     tools (context-view, evaluator) and protocols
     (spawn), distilled from capability-level versions
   - HAICC: the build cycle, entity model, collaboration
     patterns as practiced

4. The structure should support the next step: translating
   the spl4 mission into logical-level requirements that
   drive what gets built

## Constraints

- This is collaborative — structure proposals come from
  AI, meaning and steering from human
- Logical-level requirements are distinct from
  capability-level: they express intent without
  implementation detail
- The structure should be simple enough to use, not a
  taxonomy exercise
