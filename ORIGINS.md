# Origins

## Lineage

Splectrum has evolved through multiple iterations:

- **spl0/spl1:** Early explorations. Established the vision
  of entity-collaborative software creation.
- **spl2:** 13 projects. Built a container/method framework,
  tool wrappers, self-eval system, CLI. Defined the three
  pillars (Mycelium, Splectrum, HAICC), CIPs, and extensive
  architecture documents. All 33 containers passing
  self-validation. Proved the three-pillar model. Produced
  extensive positioning research (50+ systems surveyed).
- **spl3:** 9 projects. Booted the Mycelium model from
  principles to working code. Proved the record/context
  primitive, three-layer architecture, flat API, context
  traversal, and data-triggered evaluation. Built two
  operational Splectrum tools.
- **spl4 (this):** Integration. Connect the model to
  practical tool use. Advance both through dogfooding.

## What spl2 Achieved

- Proved the three-pillar model (Mycelium, Splectrum, HAICC)
- Defined the immutable-list primitive and polymorphic view
  model
- Established TDC (test-driven creation) and the brick
  principle
- Validated entity-neutral collaboration through practice
- Produced extensive positioning research (50+ systems)
- Distilled principles from analysis (15 documents)

## What spl2 Taught

- Don't build infrastructure before building real things
- Technology decisions belong to the implementing entity
- The vision was right; the approach was premature
- Each iteration compacts into the next

## What spl3 Achieved

- Proved the record/context primitive is sufficient — no
  extensions needed across 9 projects
- Three-layer architecture (logical, capability, physical)
  with two interchangeable storage substrates
- Flat API with metadata-driven behavior and context
  traversal with nearest-distance accumulation
- Changelog as sibling records with three causality modes
- Two Splectrum tools: context-view (cold-start orientation)
  and evaluator (natural language quality gates)
- Data-triggered processing as a general pattern
- Self-containment assets (TOOL.md, config.md, CONTEXT.md)
  as emergent schema candidates
- The HAICC build cycle in practice: AI decides, builds,
  evaluates; human steers and validates

## What spl3 Taught

- Build incrementally — each iteration moves some steps, not
  the whole distance
- The primitive is sufficient — resist adding new ones
- Atomic tools produce value independently before integration
- Simplicity wins — flat API over type hierarchy, transient
  metadata over premature persistence
- Vision and implementation diverge — reconcile regularly
- The model diverged from log-centric to context-centric
  during implementation, and that divergence was productive

## What spl3 Left Open

- Tools and API exist independently — not yet connected
- Metadata is transient — not yet stored/self-describing
- Three concerns (defining meaning, created meaning,
  capabilities) identifiable but not structurally separable
- Principles and positioning documents describe a broader
  vision than what was built — reconciliation done in
  spl3/analysis/

## The Transition to spl4

spl3 defined the model. spl4 connects it through use. The
practical test: do tools work better when consuming the
Mycelium API? Does stored metadata make contexts genuinely
self-describing? Does the workflow improve?
